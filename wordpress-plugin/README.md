There is a Site Search WordPress plugin available that makes Site Search integration in WordPress just a matter of a few clicks. This gives non-technical business users the flexibility to integrate Site Search into your site without any technical know-how. Absolutely no PHP code modification is required, to integrate Site Search into your site. Currently WordPress is the only the CMS where we offer the most seamless integration available, basically a plugin-driven one-click setup.
